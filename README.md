## **🏏 Cricket Score Prediction**
![Cricket Score Prediction](/image.png)


This is a **machine learning-powered** Cricket Score Prediction system that analyzes past match data and predicts the **final score** based on various match conditions like **batting team, bowling team, overs completed, wickets fallen, and recent performance**.  

It uses **Random Forest & XGBoost** models trained on **3000+ T20 matches** to make accurate predictions.  

---

## **🚀 Features**
✅ Predicts **final score** based on current match conditions  
✅ Uses **Random Forest & XGBoost** models  
✅ **Streamlit-based web app** for easy predictions  
✅ Data extracted from **YAML match files** (ball-by-ball data)  
✅ Feature Engineering: Considers factors like **last 5 overs' performance**, **current run rate**, and **wickets left**

## **🛠 Setup & Run Locally**
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Score-Card-Prediction.git
cd Score-Card-Prediction
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Ipynb files So it create 3 pkl files for pipeline the data and model**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **4️ Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Now, open **`localhost:8501`** in your browser and start predicting cricket scores! 🎉

## **📊 Model Performance**
| Model       | R² Score | MAE  | RMSE |
|------------|---------|------|------|
| **Random Forest** | 93.87%  | 5.56 | 8.28 |
| **XGBoost** | 98.0%  | 4.2  | 6.5  |

✅ **XGBoost gives better accuracy**, but RFC was used for comparison.

---

## **📌 Future Improvements**
🔹 Add **pitch & weather conditions** for better predictions  
🔹 Use **LGBM** or **Deep Learning (LSTM)** for more accurate results  
🔹 Integrate **live match data API** for real-time score updates
